# espem

ESPEM is a fast secular code which computes the evolution of a planet around a star, taking into account a lot of physical processes :
- the tide raised by the planet in the star following Benbakoura et al. 2019
- the magnetic interactions between star and planet following Ahuir et al. 2021
- the tide raised by the star in the planet following Revol et al. 2023

After these seminal works, the code has been entirely re-written in RUST.

This version will be soon available here!
